I built this password generator application from my scrimba frontend career path course. 
There's a project at the end at each module course and this is one of them.
I built it using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and the design was given to us through figma.
The project requires us to use what we have learned from the course to built, but also gives us the options to improve it by adding other features as well.
I took the initiative and built it with other options that would give the choice to include character length, uppercase, lowercase, symbols, and numbers. 
It also include the click to copy that automatically copied when you click on your password.
